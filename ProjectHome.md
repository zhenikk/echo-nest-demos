This is a set of demos built on top of the Echo Nest API that demonstrate some of the things you can do with the Echo Nest.  Current demos are:

## The BPM Explorer ##
The [BPM Explorer](http://static.echonest.com/bpmexp/bpmexp.html) is a  Processing application that will take a song and display a detailed plot of how the tempo changes over the course of the song.  You can use these 'click plots' to figure out whether a human or a machine is setting the tempo for a song. A machine-generated tempo is, well, machine like.  The BPM for these songs are rock steady  and yield a very flat BPM graph - while songs with human metronomes exhibit much more variation in the tempo over time.  (I've written more about looking at BPM to detect click tracks and drumming machines here: [In search of the click track](http://musicmachinery.com/2009/03/02/in-search-of-the-click-track/)).
